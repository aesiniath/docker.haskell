# Patch the control file used by stack to know where to download the GHC
# compiler from during the `stack setup` step if necessary. We transform URLs
# of the form
#
#   https://github.com/commercialhaskell/ghc/releases/download/ghc-8.6.3-release/ghc-8.6.3-x86_64-deb8-linux.tar.xz
#
# into
#
#   https://FIXME/org.haskell.downloads/~ghc/8.6.3/ghc-8.6.3-x86_64-deb8-linux.tar.xz
#
# Note that we are pulling these from (our mirror of) the upstream GHC
# developer's release page, not from the mirror maintained by fpcomplete on
# GitHub. This is partially for confidence in providence, and partially to
# contribute a sanity check as the stack-setup-2.yaml file contains checksums.
#
# The file being manipulated is originally at
#
#   https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-content/blob/master/stack/stack-setup-2.yaml
